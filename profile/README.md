# City Skylines

Welcome to the City Skylines modding team! We are a group of students who are passionate about programming and game development.

## About

We're college students at Tec de Monterrey under the supervision of [Professor Benjamin Valdez](https://github.com/benjaminva). We're working on a project to create educational mods for the game City Skylines. Our goal is to help players learn about urban planning, sustainability, and other important topics through interactive gameplay.

## Mission and Values

Our mission is to foster a vibrant and collaborative community of players, modders, and creators. We believe in:

- **Creativity**: Encouraging innovative ideas and creative solutions for city-building challenges.
- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming players from diverse backgrounds and ensuring everyone feels valued.
- **Quality**: Striving for excellence in all aspects of our work, from mod creation to community engagement.
- **Community**: Building strong relationships with our members and supporting each other in our shared passion for City Skylines.
- **Learning**: Providing opportunities for growth and development through tutorials, workshops, and other educational resources.

## Community Guidelines

To mantain a possitive and respectful environment, we ask all members of our community to follow these guidelines:

1. **Be Kind**: Treat others with respect and kindness, even when you disagree. Constructive criticism is welcome, but personal attacks are not.
2. **Be Helpful**: Support your fellow modders and players by sharing your knowledge and expertise. We all have something to learn from each other.
3. **Be Open-Minded**: Embrace new ideas and perspectives, and be willing to try new things. Diversity makes our community stronger.
4. **Be Patient**: Remember that everyone is at a different skill level and may need extra help or guidance. Be patient and understanding with others.
5. **Be Responsible**: Take ownership of your actions and their consequences. If you make a mistake, own up to it and work to make things right.

By following these guidelines, we can create a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone feels safe and supported. Thank you for being a part of the City Skylines modding team!
